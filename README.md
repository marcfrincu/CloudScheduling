# CloudScheduling

# Description

This project was developed between 2011-2012 as part of my work within the mOSAIC EU project (a diagram in the repository explains the integration) while pursuing my PhD studies.

It provides several demand forecast methods as well as component based scheduling (it improves the RR approach of Apache Dynamo).

# Usage

- **data**: contains several loads (real life website users) and results of several forecast methods.
- **lib**: contains all the necessary libraries (at that time I was not using Maven).
- **src**: all source code including examples in *src/mosaic/scheduler/test*.
